        <h3>How do you control TETR.IO? What are the objectives of TETR.IO?</h3>

        <p>
            TETR.IO plays like most other modern Tetris clones, but it's still worth documenting
            some
            behaviors here.
        </p>

        <h2>Movement</h2>
        <p>
            To control pieces in TETR.IO, you can use the left and right arrow keys to move pieces
            left
            and right. If you hold one of these directional keys, after a period of delay known as
            <span class="keyword">DAS</span>, the piece will automatically continue moving in that
            direction, in intervals known as <span class="keyword">ARR</span>.
        </p>

        <div class="canvas-container">
            <p>
                <b style="font-size: 1.2rem">Try it!</b>
                <br>
                <em>DAS = 167ms, ARR = 33ms</em>
            </p>
            <canvas id="auto-shift-demo" width="630" height="200">
                Your browser does not support canvas
            </canvas>
        </div>

        <p>
            In TETR.IO, both of these values can be customized, which can make the game
            <em>very</em>
            fast-paced. In fact, most of the highest-rated played play with 0ms ARR and around 100ms
            DAS.
        </p>

        <p>
            To rotate pieces, you can use the <b>Z</b> and <b>X</b> keys for counterclockwise and
            clockwise rotation, respectively. The different rotation states are governed by the
            <a href="https://tetris.fandom.com/wiki/SRS">Super Rotation System</a> made originally
            by
            the Tetris Company. TETR.IO uses a slightly modified version of this rotation system to
            change how I pieces (the long ones) behave.
        </p>

        <p>
            This rotation system also governs how pieces behave when their desired rotation state is
            overlapped by an already existing block or wall. Each rotation has four different
            positions
            that the game will try in order when rotating. Once a suitable rotation has been found,
            the
            piece will move to that orientation. If none of the four positions are valid, then no
            rotation
            occurs. For more information, read <a
                href="https://four.lol/srs/kicks-overview">this</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            TETR.IO is also somewhat unique in that it offers the option to spin a piece 180 degrees
            in
            one move. This can be achieved using the A key, and the kicks are as follows:
        </p>

        <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/EaWH8QgXgAArDEV?format=png&name=large"
             alt="TETR.IO 180 degree kick table" width="100%"/>

        <p>
            Finally, the last aspect of moving is dropping pieces on to the field. There are two
            main
            ways of doing this in TETR.IO:
            <span class="keyword">hard drop</span> and <span class="keyword">soft drop</span>.
            The majority of the time you want to place a piece, you will use hard drop; this will
            just teleport the piece downward to the ground or on top of a piece. Soft drop makes the
            piece move downward, but when it contacts another piece or the ground below it, it will
            not
            instantly lock and allow you to continue controlling it.
        </p>

        <h2>Randomizer and Hold</h2>
        <p>
            The randomizer in TETR.IO is a 7-bag system, which means that all seven kinds of pieces
            are
            shuffled in a "bag" and then given out, guaranteeing that there will be one instance of
            each piece every seven pieces. It allows for a more forgiving randomizer, since the
            longest
            you can go without a given piece is <span class="keyword">12 pieces</span>.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, there is still a mechanism to help you out if the randomizer gives you a piece
            you
            don't want: <span class="keyword">hold</span>. This feature allows you to store a piece
            you
            currently control into a hold area. Then, you will control the next piece in queue,
            allowing
            you to essentially "skip" a piece.
        </p>

        <img src="public/hold.gif" alt="Hold being used" class="center"/>

        <p>
            If your hold area already contains a piece, then pressing the hold key will simply swap
            your current piece and the piece in the hold area. You can only do this once per piece.
        </p>

        <h2>Sprint</h2>
        <img src="public/sprint.png" alt="TETR.IO Sprint Description"/>
        <p>
            Sprint is one of the most universal modes in not just TETR.IO but Tetris as a whole. It
            is a
            competition of speed where the objective is to clear a set amount of lines as fast as
            possible.
        </p>

        <p>
            In TETR.IO the only sprint mode is 40 lines, and the objective is simply to clear those
            40
            lines as fast as possible. Given the customizable ARR and DAS, there is technically no
            speed
            limit other than the human capacity. The current world record is 15.812 seconds, set by
            Hiryu.

        <h2>Blitz</h2>

        <img src="public/blitz.png" alt="TETR.IO Blitz Description"/>

        <p>
            The point of this mode is to score the most points as possible in 2 minutes, as gravity
            increases greatly. It is a stressful, high-energy mode where you go all out to try and
            rack
            up as many points as possible in many different ways.
        </p>

        <p>
            Almost everything you do will net you points, like placing pieces. The goal is to do the
            actions
            that will maximize your point gain. For example, clearing a line will net you more
            points
            than placing a block. <span class="keyword">Clearing 4 lines at once</span> nets you
            even
            more
            points. <span class="keyword">Clearing every block off of the board</span> nets you even
            more.
        </p>

        <p>
            The current world record (and most other high scores) use the last strategy of doing
            perfect
            clears to earn the most points:

        <h2>Zen</h2>

        <p>
            Zen is a training mode where you can control almost everything to practice your stacking
            skills. Points are still tracked, but there is no competitive leaderboard or objective.
