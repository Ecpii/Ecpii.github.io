        <h3>Perfection.</h3>

        <p>
            As all of the other strategies have tackled with maximizing garbage output from the
            garbage table, you might be wondering if there's a strategy involving the biggest attack
            at 0 combo - the all clear.
        </p>

        <p>
            And it turns out... there is! One popular opener is the Perfect Clear Opener, which has
            an 84.64% chance of solving into a perfect clear at the start of the match, provided
            you know all the solutions.
        </p>

        <p>
            While this sounds like a great idea - sending 10 lines at your opponent instantly, it
            often isn't that great. The main problem lies in that you are sending 10 lines in a
            single attack, meaning that the gaps in the garbage will be <b>aligned</b>. This allows
            the opponent to instantly send back a quad using that garbage if they have an I piece
            ready.
        </p>

        <p>
            Also, trying to start a match with a perfect clear can be easily countered by your
            opponent sending just one line of garbage, which only requires them to stack up 2 lines,
            while you need to stack up 4 in order to get your perfect clear.
        </p>

        <p>
            This isn't to say the perfect clear strategy is useless, however. It is most effective
            as a countermeasure to 4-Wide. Stacking and sending a perfect clear is still faster
            than building a complete 4-Wide, and this can help dampen the power of 4-Wide by only
            allowing the opponent to stack up to a certain height.
        </p>

        <p>
            A Perfect Clear can also be used when you are facing a player you know is much slower
            than you, since you can likely get the perfect clear off before they have a chance to
            defend or attack, and then you may still have enough speed advantage to add additional
            pressure onto the attack from the perfect clear. This can result in very speedy wins if
            done right.
        </p>

        <h2>Perfect Clear after Openers</h2>

        <p>
            Some openers have extended sequences that can result in perfect clears. This helps
            compensate for the non-lethal attack that perfect clears send. By doing T-Spins and
            other clears as part of an opener first, you can give the opponent some garbage to raise
            their boards up before hitting them with the perfect clear garbage.
        </p>

        <h2>Perfect Clear with a side of Perfect Clear</h2>

        <p>
            Some people think that using T-Spins isn't enough. Instead, they think that you should
            just bundle a perfect clear with another perfect clear right after. It's the best strategy
            used in Blitz, so why not here?
        </p>

        <p>
            However, this strategy isn't that easy to pull off, and still has the issues associated
            with performing a single perfect clear. To get the second perfect clear, you have to
            have <em>extensive</em> knowledge of all the perfect clear patterns, and even then, you
            might not get the perfect clears consistently because of luck. And, you have to pray
            that the opponent doesn't send you garbage while you're doing either perfect clear.
        </p>

        <p>
            It's a very high risk, high reward idea, which is exactly what perfect clears are in the
            first place.
        </p>
