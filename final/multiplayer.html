        <h1>Multiplayer</h1>
        <h3>How is a puzzle game turned into a multiplayer experience? How do players interact?</h3>

        <p>
            In singleplayer, much of the goal in Tetris is to earn the most points by clearing lines
            and placing blocks. In multiplayer, the goal is a bit different - to
            <span class="keyword">top out</span> your opponent.
        </p>

        <h2>Sending Garbage</h2>
        <p>
            In order to top out your opponent, you send them <span class="keyword">garbage</span>
            when you clear lines. How much garbage you send depends on how many lines you clear at
            once, the type of clear, and other factors. It's all detailed in the following table:
        </p>

        <img
                src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/673303546564968566/716080410702118922/2020-05-30_02-07-18.png"
                alt="TETR.IO garbage table"
                width="100%"
        />

        <p>
            After you perform one of the above clears, after a set delay, the opponent will receive
            the garbage.
        </p>

        <h2>T-Spins</h2>
        <p>
            In the garbage table, you may have noticed the word "T-Spin". These refers to line
            clears
            done by soft-dropping the T-piece into a slot and rotating it. Of course, that is an
            over-simplified description, and more details can be found
            <a href="https://tetris.wiki/T-Spin">here</a>.
        </p>

        <p>
            The most important part about T-Spins, though, are their efficiency. In the garbage
            table,
            you will notice that <span class="keyword">T-Spin Doubles</span> will send <b>the
            same</b>
            amount of garbage as Quads. However, T-Spin Doubles only requires you to clear two
            lines,
            while Quads require you to clear four lines. This means that you can build less (and
            spend
            less time stacking) to send the same amount of garbage. This is why they're so often
            used
            in modern Tetris.
        </p>

        <h2>Back 2 Back</h2>
        <p>
            In the garbage table above, you may have also noticed the acronym "B2B". This refers
            to consecutively clearing only Quads or T-Spins. As you do so, you send more and more
            garbage with each attack. However, the B2B chain can be easily broken by just one
            <span class="keyword">skim</span>.
        </p>

        <h2>Receiving Garbage</h2>
        <p>
            When your opponent sends you garbage, it gets stored in a queue on the side of your
            board. It will not be sent to your board immediately, but only after you place a piece
            which does not clear a line.
        </p>

        <video autoplay muted loop>
            <source src="public/garbage%20demo.mp4">
        </video>

        <p>
            If you do place a piece that clears a line, the garbage will not be transferred to your
            board - it will, however, remain in your queue. If the line clear you just performed
            was able to send garbage, the amount you sent will be subtracted from the amount of
            garbage you are waiting to receive. This allow you to cancel attacks with other attacks.
