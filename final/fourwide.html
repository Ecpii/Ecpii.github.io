        <h1>4-Wide</h1>
        <h3>An infamous, but effective, winning strategy.</h3>
        <p>
            In the garbage table shown before in <a href="multiplayer.html">multi</a>, you may
            have noticed that the garbage table goes all the way to 20 in
            <span class="keyword">combo</span>, and the garbage amounts increase with combo.
            This can give your attacks tremendous combo power, since all the attacks will add up
            and be sent to your opponent. The following widget shows how much attack would be sent
            clearing <em>just singles</em> to get to a certain combo.
        </p>

        <div id="combo-demo">
            <label for="combo-slider">Combo: <span>1x</span></label><br>
            <input type="range" min="1" max="20" value="1" class="slider" id="combo-slider">
            <p>Cumulative attack:</p>
            <span style="font-size: 1.5rem; font-weight: bold">0</span>
        </div>

        <p>
            As shown, the power of combos is nothing to scoff at in this game; after 13 combos you
            have sent <b>20 lines</b> of garbage, the full height of the board, and bound to kill
            unless your opponent cancels part of the attack.
        </p>

        <p>
            Thus, a stacking strategy was created to abuse the combo system: 4-Wide. In this stacking
            strategy, you build a gap that is four minos wide (as implied in the name), and leave 3
            residue minos in the well:
        </p>

        <img src="public/fourwide%20example.png" alt="four wide example" width="100%"/>

        <p>
            This has been shown to be an optimal way to secure combo, since there are many patterns
            in which you can place pieces to continually clear lines.
        </p>

        <video preload muted controls width="800">
            <source src="public/fourwide%20power.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>

        <p>
            Also, as shown in the video, you could possibly have garbage lines under the 4-Wide which
            will benefit even more from the combo bonus. A 4-combo quad does double the damage with no combo,
            and 8 combo does triple, 12 combo quadruple, etc.
        </p>

        <h2>Center 4-Wide</h2>
        <p>
            There are two main variations of 4-Wide and this is the one generally considered more
            powerful. This requires you to build your gap in the center, which makes the sides
            harder to stack since you only have 3 minos of space on each side. Thus, this is generally
            used in more higher level play/with higher level players.
        </p>

        <p>
            However, it boasts many advantages. The most major of which is that you are less prone
            to topping out. Even if the opponent sends you lots of garbage to get the rest of your
            stack above the 20th line, you still won't have covered your piece spawn position, since
            the middle of your stack is a big gap:
        </p>

        <video autoplay muted loop width="800">
            <source src="public/c4w%20example.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        </video>

        <p>
            A consequence of this is that your stack is virtually larger, since you could get lucky
            and continue your combo through the garbage after you have exhausted your 4-Wide.
        </p>

        <p>
            Another advantage is that you can place your pieces faster than the other variation since
            your pieces are already spawning in the gap, so you don't need to move them as far.
        </p>

        <p>
            But again, this type of stacking requires more thinking because you only have 3 minos
            of space to work with on each side, and therefore must actively consider the pieces in
            the next queue in order to stack quickly.
        </p>

        <h2>Side 4-Wide</h2>
        <img src="public/s4w%20example.png" alt="Side 4-Wide" />
        <p>
            Because Center 4-Wide isn't very easy to build, some players may choose to instead build
            the 4-wide gap on the side of the board. This forsakes all the advantages of c4w for
            ease of building.
        </p>

        <p>
            Using this strategy, you are very prone to dying, since just a couple lines of garbage
            will shift your stack up to cover piece spawn positions. Additionally, you have to shift
            all your pieces to the side before you can place them, making your attack pressure
            much slower.
        </p>

        <p>
            For some players, this slow down in attack may be worth the faster and
            <span class="keyword">easier stacking</span>. However, the main factor is usually
            still the risk in getting topped-out while building, and most people eventually shift
            to using c4w.
        </p>

        <h2>
            General Notes
        </h2>
        <p>
            Despite its power, and likely because of its power, most people look down on using 4-Wide.
            It is said to make the gameplay very stale, since it is just executing the same patterns
            to maintain combo throughout the game. It is also hated because of its unmatched power;
            many players have said that the only way to beat four-wide consistently is to use four-wide
            against it. <em>Fight fire with fire</em>.
        </p>

        <p>
            It also allows perhaps less-skilled players to beat higher-skilled players, so many
            look at it like its a crutch, a substitute for skill.
