    <h3>Credits, Regrets, Todos...</h3>
    This site, made to be a final project for <em>Advanced Web Design: JavaScript</em>, was designed
    and made by <b>Wayne He</b>. Created using JetBrains WebStorm.<br>
    A lot of the colors and design ideas were <s>stolen</s> inspired by UIs and menus in
    <a href="https://tetr.io">TETR.IO</a>,
    <a href="https://osu.ppy.sh">osu!</a>,
    <a href="https://four.lol">four.lol</a>,
    and <a href="https://osk.sh">osk's sites</a>.
    <br>
    <br>
    <b>Note:</b> This site is in no way affiliated with the above sites, including TETR.IO, which is
    an
    independent creation of osk. The TETR.IO icon and brand are both properties of osk.

    <h2>JavaScript Features (for the rubric)</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Video and caption cycling on the landing page
        </li>
        <li>
            Navbar collapsing/expanding
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
            Above timer
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Regrets/Wishes/Todos</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>
            The transition in the landing page videos isn't smooth at all since it causes a
            re-render.
        </li>
        <li>
            Landing page text is honestly still too obtrusive but I don't have a great eye for
            design so ¯\_(ツ)_/¯.
        </li>
        <li>
            Spent longer than I should've on some components, it took me a whole day for the
            menu bar, when I could've settled for something less perfect.
        </li>
        <li>
            Tried to make wikipedia like pop-ups but I don't want to spend so much time figuring
            out how to overlay them (previous point), so they kinda suck right now.
        </li>
        <li>
            The code for the navbar could be much better.
        </li>
        <li>
            The green mechanics button is somehow on top of the logo button, even though the logo
            button has a higher z-index. Honestly confused on why this is and don't know a fix.
        </li>
        <li>
            The content of this site kinda sucks as an introduction to TETR.IO,
            it was really made more for the JS.
        </li>
    </ul>
